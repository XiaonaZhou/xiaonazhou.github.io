-***Open Source Computational Framework in R for Studying Biological Rhythms via Analysis of Behavioral Phase and Circular Statistics‚Äù*** 

Published in STAR  Protocols in March, 2021

This protocol describes a standardized method for analyzing Drosophila behavioral rhythmicity under light dark cycles, temperature ramps, and free running conditions. The protocol constitutes a step-by-step guide from generation of appropriate Drosophila genetic crosses to behavioral experiments. We also provide an open-source computational framework using R for the analysis of the phase of behavior using circular statistics. An extended method for complete use is also provided.
